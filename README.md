# Color Flipper
A simple web application that changes the background color of the page to a randomly generated HEX color with the click of a button.

## Overview
**Purpose**: This app allows users to randomly change the background color of the webpage by clicking a button. Each color is displayed as a HEX value, making it a fun and interactive tool for experimenting with colors.

**Design**: The application has a clean, minimalist design with a centered layout. It features a button to flip the color, and the current color is displayed prominently beneath the button.

**Functionality**: The app generates random HEX colors and updates both the background color and the displayed color value each time the button is clicked.
